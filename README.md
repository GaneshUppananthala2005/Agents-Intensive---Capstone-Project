####🎯 How you can use them in your 5-day course

##Day 1: Introduce basics — use the “data cleaning / basic ML” sections of drakearch/kaggle-courses + a simple project from Kaggle-Projects or kaggle-notebooks

##Day 2: Data exploration & visualization — use notebooks from kaggle-notebooks to show EDA on real datasets

##Day 3: Feature engineering + preprocessing — take code from drakearch/kaggle-courses + Kaggle-Projects

##Day 4: Modeling & evaluation (ML algorithms, cross-validation) — use example projects from the repos to illustrate proper modeling workflows

##Day 5: Advanced topics or mini-projects — let students explore any project from the big “500-AI-…” repository or pick a Kaggle notebook, to implement end-to-end workflow (data → model → evaluation)
